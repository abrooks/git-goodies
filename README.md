## frebase

"FREEbase" or "F-rebase" as you prefer.

`git-rebase` is a wonderfully handy history rewriting tool for local workflows but,
once you have pushed the changes, rewriting history will only make a mess. It is quite common,
with both long-running topic branches or tracking third-party repos to be able to maintain a
clear, concise set of commits against the mainline. Some developers handle this by rebasing
onto an entirely new branch but this creates a massive proliferation of branches that becomes
hard to maintain and manage. `frebase` allows you to rebase your changes against the mainline
on top of (instead of in place of) your existing history.
